# Spring Boot microservice example

In this scenario we implemented a simple use case to show the usage of Spring Boot in order to implement microservice and Swagger
to implement it.

In order to build and run it you should only run the following commands

```console
$  mvn clean package && mvn spring-boot:run
```

The embedded web service will run on 8080 port.

An URL example for GET method: http://localhost:8080/footballplayer

The URL for test Swagger-UI http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
